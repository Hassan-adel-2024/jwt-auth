# Jwt-authentication
A JWT authentication project with a refresh token in Spring Boot allows users to log in, receive an access token (JWT) and a refresh token. The access token is used for authenticating API requests, while the refresh token is used to obtain a new access token when it expires, ensuring continuous access without re-authentication.
